Simulation Problem
=====================

I. Let α = 0.05

   1. Draw a sample of size n = 35  ~N(µ = 3, σ2 =  4), Assume  σ2 unknown.
   2. Compute  z
   3. Decision
   4. Determine if decision is correct or incorrect.
   5. Run the above steps N = 100 times and determine the percentage of making an incorrect decision. Is this close to 0.05?

II. Do the previous problem with n = 20, σ2 unknown and t.
