Simulation Problem
=====================

Let $\alpha = 0.05$

1. Draw a sample of size $n = 35 \sim N(\mu = 3, \sigma^2 =  4)$, Assume  $\sigma^2$ unknown.
2. Compute  $z$
3. Decision
4. Determine if decision is correct or incorrect.
5. Run the above steps $N = 100$ times and determine the percentage of making an incorrect decision. Is this close to $0.05$?

Do the previous problem with $n = 20$, $\sigma^2$ unknown and t.
